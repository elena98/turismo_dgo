              those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who 
              loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain 
              can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
               advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who 
            chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
